## Database Design

- **User Table:**
  - id (PK), username, email, password_hash, created_at, etc.
- **Todo Table:**
  - id (PK), user_id (FK), title, description, status, priority, due_date, created_at, image_filename, etc.
- **Relationships:**
  - One user can have many todos (one-to-many)
  - Each todo references its owner via user_id (foreign key)
    > See the 'Database Elements' section below for more details.

---

## UI/UX Design

- The UI/UX for this application is based on a Figma design.
- The design emphasizes clarity, ease of use, and a modern look for both desktop and mobile users.
- Key features:
  - Sidebar navigation for quick access to Dashboard, Vital Tasks, My Tasks, and Profile
  - Responsive layout for all devices
  - Modal dialogs for editing, adding, and deleting tasks
  - Visual feedback for actions (e.g., success messages, error notifications)
  - Consistent color palette and typography

## Database Elements

The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts, todo tasks, and related data. The main elements are:

- **User Table**
  - Stores user account information (username, email, password hash, etc.)
  - Each user can have multiple todo tasks
- **Todo Table**
  - Stores individual todo tasks
  - Fields include: title, description, status, priority, due date, creation date, image filename, etc.
  - Each todo is linked to a user (owner)
- **Authentication & Security**
  - Passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt)
  - JWT tokens are used for authentication
- **Other Elements**
  - Uploaded images are stored on disk (not in the database), with the database storing the filename/path
    **Relationships:**
- One-to-many: One user can have many todos
- Each todo references its owner via a foreign key

---

## Kubernetes Deployment Flow

When you launch the application on Kubernetes, the following flow occurs:

1. **PostgreSQL Deployment**
   - A Postgres pod is created to provide the database for the app.
   - A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) ensures database data persists across pod restarts.
2. **Backend Deployment (FastAPI)**
   - The backend pod runs the FastAPI app, connecting to Postgres.
   - A PVC is mounted at `/app/uploads` to persist uploaded files (images).
   - The backend exposes API endpoints for authentication, todos, and file uploads.
3. **Frontend Deployment (React/Vite)**
   - The frontend pod serves the React single-page app (SPA) using a static server.
   - The frontend communicates with the backend via internal cluster networking (service names).
4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**
   - The Nginx pod acts as a reverse proxy for all external traffic.
   - Nginx routes:
     - `/auth/`, `/todos/`, `/uploads/` → backend service
     - All other paths → frontend service
   - Nginx is exposed via a NodePort or LoadBalancer, making the app accessible outside the cluster.
5. **Service Discovery & Networking**
   - Each component (frontend, backend, nginx, postgres) is exposed as a Kubernetes Service.
   - Internal DNS allows pods to communicate using service names (e.g., `api`, `frontend`, `postgres`).
6. **Persistence**
   - Database data and uploaded files are stored on PVCs, so data survives pod restarts or rescheduling.
7. **Scaling & Health**
   - Deployments can be scaled (replica count) for frontend and backend.
   - Readiness/liveness probes ensure only healthy pods receive traffic.
8. **Access Flow**
   - User accesses the app via the Nginx external URL (NodePort/LoadBalancer IP).
   - Nginx proxies API and upload requests to the backend, and serves the frontend SPA for all other routes.
   - The frontend app makes API calls to the backend through the same Nginx endpoint (same-origin).

## Backend API Endpoints

Below are the main API endpoints exposed by the FastAPI backend:

- **Authentication**

  - `POST /auth/signup` — Register a new user
  - `POST /auth/login` — Authenticate and receive JWT token
  - `GET /auth/me` — Get current user info (requires JWT)
  - `POST /auth/change-password` — Change user password (requires JWT)

- **Todos**

  - `GET /todos` — List all todos for the authenticated user
  - `POST /todos` — Create a new todo
  - `GET /todos/{id}` — Get a specific todo by ID
  - `PUT /todos/{id}` — Update a todo by ID
  - `DELETE /todos/{id}` — Delete a todo by ID

- **Uploads**
  - `POST /todos` (with image) — Upload an image as part of todo creation
  - `GET /uploads/{filename}` — Retrieve uploaded image by filename
